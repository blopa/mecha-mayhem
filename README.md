### Description
In **MechaMayhem**, you play as an incredibly smart scientist. Some would say the smartest - except Mrs. Danewood - she never called you smart. 

After she flunked you out of fifth grade for creating a self-propelled robot instead of a potato-powered clock, you spend your next 20 years developing a Mech that supersedes any grading scale…

 On the day of (now Mayor) Danewood's reckoning, you, inside your Mech, are poised to take back the city from the corrupt Mayor. You with your lasers, and Mayor Danewood with her politically-gained Pterodactyl bombs, are poised for the ultimate showdown.

_ALAS! _At the penultimate hour, disaster strikes! Your Mech has malfunctioned, forcing you to manually enact the necessary processes to ensure mayor Danewood's ultimate destruction.

Can you quickly regain control of your robotic-creation? Or will Mayor Danewood flunk you one last time...
